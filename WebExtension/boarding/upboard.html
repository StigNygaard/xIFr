  <h1>Congratulations!</h1>

  <p>xIFr, your EXIF-viewer, has been updated to version <span class="verstr"></span>.</p>

  <p>If you haven't already, I suggest you to take quick look at the introduction. You might learn a thing or two
    about xIFr that you didn't already know:</p>

  <p class="introlink"><a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/start/" title="Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-context="upboard">xIFr - Getting started</a></p>

  <p>Also, make sure to make a visit to xIFr's <a href="/options/options.html" class="settings"><em>Options Page</em></a> where you can
    adjust some aspects of how xIFr looks and behaves. Look for the wheel
    <img src="../icons/wheel-48.png" class="settings" alt="" /> in the metadata popup to access the options. My
    personal favorite settings are "Dark Theme" and the "Snap right" popup positioning.</p>

  <p>In a number of frequent recent updates, xIFr have brought several <strong>improvements to the <em>Deep Search</em>
    functionality</strong>. On some pages where xIFr had trouble finding images before, it has become much better now.</p>

  <p><strong>Trouble with xIFr?</strong> If xIFr generally doesn't work, it might be a conflict with settings in
    an ad-blocker or privacy extension you have installed in the browser. Lately a couple of users solved conflicts
    with uBlock Origin filters using
    <a href="https://github.com/StigNygaard/xIFr/issues/17#issuecomment-1636860473" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Issue-tracker on GitHub">fix described here</a>.</p>

  <p>I hope you are happy with and enjoy using xIFr. If you have questions or comments, there are
    <a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various ways you can provide feedback</a>.</p>
