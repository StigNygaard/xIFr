  <h1>xIFr has been updated!</h1>

  <p>xIFr, your EXIF-viewer, has been updated to version <span class="verstr"></span>.</p>

  <p>If you haven't already, I suggest you to take quick look at the introduction. You might learn a thing or two
    about xIFr that you didn't already know:</p>

  <p class="introlink"><a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/start/" title="Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-context="upboard">xIFr - Getting started</a></p>

  <p>Also, make sure to make a visit to xIFr's <a href="/options/options.html" class="settings"><em>Options Page</em></a>
    where you can adjust some aspects of how xIFr looks and behaves. Look for the wheel
    <img src="../icons/wheel-48.png" class="settings" alt="" /> in xIFr window to access the options. My
    personal favorite settings are "Dark Theme" and the "Snap right" popup positioning.</p>

  <p><b>xIFr version 3</b> upgrades the "extension type" from <em>Manifest version 2</em> to <em>Manifest version 3</em>.
    This is a technical thing that hopefully doesn't affect users in practice, but there might be a small risk
    that xIFr stops working on a few pages/images where earlier versions used to work. If you discover any issues,
    don't hesitate to contact me and I will see if it is something I can fix. There are
    <a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various ways you can provide feedback</a>.</p>

  <p>I should probably also mention that I have made a few changes to the <em>wording</em> of the
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xifr/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.
    It is only to make it clearer and avoid misunderstandings. There's no changes to the policy as such.</p>

<!--  <p>I hope you are happy with and enjoy using xIFr. If you have questions or comments, there are-->
