    <p>Note, you are shown this "onboarding-page" a second time after your initial installation of xIFr, because
      there's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1558336">a Firefox bug</a> that might have
      closed this page the first time, just as you where about to read it.</p>

  <h1>Congratulations!</h1>

  <p>xIFr version <span class="verstr"></span> has been installed.</p>

  <p>With this tool you can see a lot of the metadata that can be embedded in JPEG files. Various data of types EXIF,
    IPTC and XMP are supported.</p>

  <p>To see (if there are) any recognized metadata in an image, you can usually just right-click the image and choose
    "View EXIF data" in your browser's contextmenu. But to get the best of xIFr, I suggest you to read the introduction:</p>

  <p class="introlink"><a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/start/" title="Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-context="onboard">xIFr - Getting started</a></p>

  <p>Also, make sure to make a visit to xIFr's <a href="/options/options.html" class="settings"><em>Options Page</em></a>
    where you can adjust some aspects of how xIFr looks and behaves. Look for the wheel
    <img src="../icons/wheel-48.png" class="settings" alt="" /> in the xIFr window to access the options.
    My personal favorite settings are "Dark Theme" and the "Snap right" popup positioning.</p>

  <p>I hope you'll find xIFr useful and enjoy using it...</p>
