Privacy Policy for xIFr

As the developer and provider of xIFr, I have no interest in or intent to collect data about users or usage of xIFr or websites, besides the basic add-on statistics automatically collected by Mozilla. In general xIFr ain't running until either launched from context-menu or by opening addon's Options page, and no data is processed, collected or shared unless needed for the addon's described functionality.

xIFr reads and presents data about image files embedded on webpages, and does so no matter if an image file is located on same domain as the webpage itself or embedded from some other domain. To show position of geotagged photos, xIFr will embed a map from - and communicate geolocation data to - a 3rd party map-provider (Currently <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>). But besides the needed data shared to show a map with photo-location, xIFr does not share any data with 3rd parties. And communication with the map-provider does not happen until the "Map" tab in xIFr is selected for a geotagged photo.

If you have questions or feedback to privacy policy or xIFr in general, please see contact and feedback options at <a href="https://www.rockland.dk/xIFr/">www.rockland.dk/xIFr</a>.
